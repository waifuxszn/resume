            <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                Hello! My name is Samson Koleosho, and I am a freelance software developer. I am an upcoming 
                graduate of Stevenson University with a major in Software Design. While in school, I took a 
                variety of class that helped improve my knowledge of languages such as Python, Java, and C#, 
                as well as the HTML5 and CSS3 markup languages. Using what I picked up in school, I became a 
                freelance webpage developer, making sites in my free time. In addition, I used my time in college 
                to familiarize myself with the Adobe Creative Suite, introducing myself to applications such as Adobe 
                Animate, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. While it was not my major, I am open to 
                learning even more about using these programs to improve my web designs. In addition, I also have a
                substantial amount of experience in game development. Using the ROBLOX platform, I have both created 
                projects and been on a good amount of developmental teams, utilizing various coding fundamentals, 
                including object-oriented programming. I have several projects that I have worked on over the years, 
                both in web design and in general development, and they are linked in the GitHub link above. 
                I am eager to take my first real step into the industry!
